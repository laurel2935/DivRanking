1. error caused by ndeval10 calling
(1) The program can't start because cygwin1.dll is missing
Specifically, e.g., if ndeval10.exe works, the output command line should be: the usage help

Be sue to add: "C:\cygwin\bin" to system path (!!!! finally restart the exlipse platform)

(2) if it still not work, you have to recompile it. BTW, if gcc is not installed, please install this package.

if there is conflicting getline error, rename the getline function in the source file to "get_line"
